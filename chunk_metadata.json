Basis of Claims Payment (For International Cover  only)  \nCurrency : Please specify the currency You wish to be paid in. On rare occasions, We may not be able to make a \npayment in that  currency due to international banking regulations. If this happens, We will identify a suitable \nalternative currency.  If We have to make a conversion from one currency to another, We will use the exchange rate \nthat applied on the date the invoices were is sued, or on the date that We pay  Your  claim.  \nPlease note that We reserve the right to choose which currency exchange rate to apply.  \n \n28. Cost Sharing  \na. You  shall bear 20% of Co-Payment  for each and every claim payable under Section C Part B III- Dental Plan \nBenefits (Optional cover) and Our liability, if any, shall only be in excess of that sum.  \nb. If opted, a n aggregate Deductible as specified in the Policy Schedule will apply for expenses under Inpatient  \nplan benefits outside India.  \n \n29.

The maximum c umulative increase in the Limit of Indemnity will be limited to 100% of  Domestic Cover’s  base  \nSum Insured.  \nii. This clause does not alter the annual character of this insurance or Our right to decline to renew or to cancel the \nPolicy, under the circumstances described in cancellation clause stated under the Policy  \niii. If a claim is made in any year where a cumulative increase has been applied, then the increased Limit of \nIndemnity in the Policy Period of the subsequent Global Health Care  Policy shall be reduced by  20%, save that \nthe limit of indemnity applicable shall be preserved.  \n \n30. Changing country of residence  \nIt is important to let Us know when You change Your  country of residence. This may affect  Your  cover, the \navailability of the services included in  Your  plan or  Your  premium, even if You are moving to an area within  Your  \nNetwork, as  Your  existing plan may not be valid there. Cover in some countries is subject to local health insurance \nrestrictions, particularly for residents of that country. It is Your  responsibility to ensure that  Your  health cover is \nlegally appropriate. If You are not sure, please get independent legal advice, as We may no longer be able to cover \nYou. The cover We provide is not a substitute for loca l compulsory health insurance.  \n \n31. Withdrawal of Policy  \ni.

This Policy cannot be modified by anyone \n(including an insurance agent or broker) except the Company.

The Policyholder may be changed during the Policy Period only in case of his/her demise or him/her \nmoving out of India.  \n \n33.
