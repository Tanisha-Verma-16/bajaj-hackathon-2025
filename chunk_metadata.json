The Company intends to use the contents dynamically based on the \ncoverage offered to the Policyholder/Insured; e.g. If the Insured Person doesn’t opt for “Trip Delay”, then wording, \nterms and conditions related to this Specific Section will not be shown on the Policy Wordings. Similarly, general \nexclusions or general conditions which might not be applicable for Sections chosen by Policyholder/Insured will not \nbe shown. Idea of doing thi s is to make policy wording more apt and concise to customer need and provide relevant \ninformation to customer.   \n ",
